\section{Performance}

All lemmas and theorems are shown to be verifying and terminating except for the ones presented in Section~\ref{sect:thmRegEx}. The total time required for verification on a pc with Dual-Core Intel® Core™ i5-4210U CPU @ 1.70GHz processor and 8GB memory is 1670.178s with the longest time for a single step being 241.744s. For termination, the total time required on the same architecture is 1936.337s, with the longest step lasting for 613.622s (\inline{couldHaveDefinedOtherWay}).
